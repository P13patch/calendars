# Meetup Calendars Merge

This simple node.js app allows users to provide it with a list of meetup groups and returns an .ics file with all of those groups' published events.

The project can be run with:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start:dev`

Then the project will be accessible on port `3000`

The api is explorable at http://localhost:3000/api
